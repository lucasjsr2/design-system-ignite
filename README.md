Welcome to Design System Ignite! This design system is a recreation of Rocketseat's lessons, providing a set of reusable components, color palettes, typography, and linting configurations to kickstart your web development projects.

## Features

- 📚 Comprehensive documentation with interactive Storybook.
- 🚀 Fast and efficient monorepo setup using Turborepo.
- 🎨 Tokens package with pre-defined colors, fonts, borders and more.
- 🧹 ESLint configuration for consistent code style across your project.
- ⚛️ React components to build your applications using the design system.

## Packages

This monorepo is organized into the following packages:

1. **`docs`**: The documentation and interactive playground powered by Storybook. Explore and experiment with the available components and styles [here](https://lucasjsr2.github.io/design-system-ignite).

2. **`eslint-config`**: A shareable ESLint configuration to ensure consistent code quality throughout your project. This configuration follows the best practices used in this design system.

3. **`react`**: The core package that includes all the reusable components to build your applications using the design system. This is the heart of Design System Ignite.

4. **`tokens`**: A package containing essential design tokens such as colors, fonts, and borders. You can import these tokens into your stylesheets or use them directly in your components.

5. **`ts-config`**: TypeScript configuration that provides a solid setup for your TypeScript-based projects using this design system.

## Demo
Explore the interactive Storybook to see the available components and their variations. You can experiment with different props and states of the components to get a better understanding of how they work.

The Storybook is a great way to visualize and test the components, making it easier for you to integrate them into your projects. Feel free to play around with the components to see how they fit your design needs!
